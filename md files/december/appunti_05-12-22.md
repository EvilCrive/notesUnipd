## Computational Genomics

in the alr divide each count data by the reference
taxa means general, species means a matrix with all data (taxonomic)
the transformation mostly used is the clr (most used cuz sparsity of data)
back to euclidean space where we can use our math
 
distinguish technical 0 from biological 0

parameters are taxon specific, EM expectation maximization

we take log likelihood, instead of likelihood for precision pc issue, log of small number is bigger number, so PCs have less problems calculating things

probability that that datapoint comes from the gamma/from gamma+gaussian
