## Distributed System

Transactions, ACID, serial equivalent.
nested transactions.
optimistic, concurency and control. run each transaction in a virtual, private environment.

## Learning from Networks

Learn a function to assign a real value to each graph Gi. approach 1 mean of embeddings, approach2 virtual node g, embedding of graph G is the embedding of the virtual node g (z_g)

Graph neural networks. limitations of shallow embeddings: large number of parameters (complex models, overfitting), cannot generate embeddings for new nodes (that werent present in training phase). 
neural message passing framework. the graph defines the computation graph.
