## Computational Genomics

T_ik level, number of RNA molecules corresponding to i in the sample k.
poisson distribution used when having big n and low p: when we have a binomial distribution with large n and small p, that binomial distribution is well approximated by the poisson distribution

T_ik is itself a random variable => so $\lambda$ is a r.v. too.

overdisperion parameter

log vs log plot, to have a better readable plot (can range from 1 to thousands, so log helps to mantain a good scale)

we know the distribution only under the null hypothesis (student t distribution)
